# 🌱 Day 01 – Kicking Off Linux Practice!

## 🧠 What I Did Today

Started my official Linux journey 💻. Today was full-on basic vibe check with the terminal. No heavy stuff — just getting comfortable with file navigation, making folders, touching files, and knowing where I'm at in the system.

Basically, I:
- Learned basic commands like `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`
- Made folders and files using `mkdir` and `touch`
- Tried viewing file contents with `cat`, `less`
- Used `clear`, `history`, and `man` commands
- Got comfortable with the shell and prompt

## 🛠️ Commands I Practiced

```bash
pwd                  # shows current directory
ls                   # lists files/folders
cd foldername        # move into a folder
cd ..                # move one step back
mkdir linux-stuff    # create folder
touch hello.txt      # make an empty file
clear                # clear terminal screen
man ls               # manual for ls command
history              # shows all used commands

⚠️ Funny Mistakes I Made

    Tried to cd into a folder that didn’t exist → terminal roasted me 😂

    Typed cls instead of clear (Windows muscle memory 😤)

💡 Takeaways

    Linux file system is like a huge tree 🌳

    Commands are short but powerful — you just need to remember their vibe

    man is like Google for terminal

    Feeling more confident already!
