## 🚀 Terminal Shortcuts I Learned Today

Today I explored some mad useful shortcuts that are seriously gonna boost my terminal speed ⚡️

| Shortcut       | What it does                          |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| `Ctrl + A`     | Takes me to the **start of the line** 🏁 |
| `Ctrl + E`     | Zooms to the **end of the line** 🚀     |
| `Ctrl + U`     | Deletes **everything before the cursor** ❌⬅️ |
| `Ctrl + K`     | Deletes **everything after the cursor** ❌➡️ |
| `Ctrl + R`     | Opens up **search for past commands** 🔍 |
| `!!`           | Runs the **last command again** 🔁        |

I practiced them one by one and they are already becoming muscle memory 😎

## ⚙️ Bash vs Zsh

Bro I confirmed I’m using **ZSH** and not Bash.  
ZSH is looking cooler and smarter — got auto-suggestions and feels smoother.  
(Also installed **Oh My Zsh** already earlier 👌)

## 🔗 Aliases: Shortcut for Commands

Today I learned how to create aliases — like nicknames for long commands.

I tried creating one for `git status`:

echo "alias gs='git status'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

Worked like a charm ✅ Now I just type gs and boom, git status runs 😎
🛠️ I also tested custom aliases for my ROS2 stuff:

    pubsub, talker, listener aliases — all worked perfectly 🔊📢
    But I didn’t make them permanent YET. Why?

    Right now I’m learning... if I shortcut everything, I might skip mastering core commands.
    So for now I'm just practicing aliases but keeping it manual.
    Once I become a real robotics guy, I’ll set them all and make the terminal look like a robo-ninja's system 👾🤖

🧾 Summary

    Mastered essential Linux terminal shortcuts 💡

    Switched from Bash to Zsh (already done in previous customization)

    Practiced creating aliases for useful commands

    Decided to wait before setting permanent aliases — so I don’t miss out on learning process




Linux feels more like a tool I command now — not just a black screen. I’m starting to shape it for my robotics grind.
